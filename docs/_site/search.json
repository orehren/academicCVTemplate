Ensure you have it installed as described in the Installation Guide.\nThe two key functions you will use are load_cv_sheets() and format_typst_section().\n\n\n\nThe functions expect your Google Sheet to be organized with one sheet (tab) per CV section. For example:\n\nA sheet named “Education”\nA sheet named “Working Experiences”\nA sheet named “Skills”\n\nEach row in a sheet represents an entry in that section. The column headers in your sheet will become the field names for each entry (e.g., “Degree”, “Institution”, “Year”).\n\n\n\nThe first step in your .qmd file is to load the data from your Google Sheet.
