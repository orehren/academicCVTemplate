# Styling and Customization

The `academicCVTemplate` allows for extensive customization through YAML configuration and direct Typst styling.

## 1. Basic Styling (YAML)

You can change the main accent color and fonts in the `style` section of your YAML header. See the **[YAML Reference](./yaml_reference.qmd#style)** for all options.

```yaml
style:
  color-accent: "5e81ac"
  font-header: "Lato"
```

## 2. Advanced Styling (Typst Inline Code)

A powerful feature is the ability to use **Typst inline code** directly within your Google Sheet data.

### How it Works

The template processes data in `markup` mode. You can use the `#` symbol to call Typst functions or standard Typst syntax (like `\` for line breaks).

**Example:**
Highlight a project name and force a line break.

**In Google Sheets:**

| title | location |
| :--- | :--- |
| Research Associate in `#text(fill: rgb("5e81ac"), weight: "bold")[My Project]` | University \ of Science |

**Rendered Result:**
*   "My Project" appears in the accent color and bold.
*   "University" and "of Science" appear on separate lines.

**Context:**
The content is handled as if it is in Typst markup mode.
*   `#text(...)[]` works.
*   `text(...)[]` (without hash) does **not** work.

For available functions, see the **[Official Typst Documentation](https://typst.app/docs/)**.

## 3. Modifying Templates

For deep customization, you can modify the Typst partials located in `_extensions/orehren/acvt/typst/`. See **[Structure](./structure.qmd#file-reference)** for a file list.
