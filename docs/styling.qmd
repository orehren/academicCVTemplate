# Styling and Customization

The `academicCVTemplate` allows for extensive customization through YAML configuration and direct Typst styling.

## 1. Basic Styling (YAML)

You can change the main accent color and fonts in the `style` section of your YAML header:

```yaml
style:
  color-accent: "5e81ac" # Hex code (without #)
  font-header: "Lato"
  font-text: "Roboto"
```

## 2. Advanced Styling (Typst Inline Code)

A powerful feature of this template is the ability to use **Typst inline code** directly within your Google Sheet data. This allows you to style specific words or cells without changing the global template.

### How it Works

The template processes data in `markup` mode. This means you can use the `#` symbol to call Typst functions within your text.

**Example:**
Suppose you want to highlight the project name in your job title and force a line break in the location.

**In Google Sheets:**

| title | location |
| :--- | :--- |
| Research Associate in `#text(fill: rgb("5e81ac"), weight: "bold")[My Project]` | University `#linebreak()` of Science |

**Rendered Result:**
*   "My Project" will appear in the accent color and bold.
*   "University" and "of Science" will be on separate lines.

**Context:**
The content is handled as if it is in Typst markup mode.
*   `#text(...)[]` works.
*   `text(...)[]` (without hash) does **not** work (treated as plain text).

For a full reference of available functions, see the **[Official Typst Documentation](https://typst.app/docs/)**.

## 3. Typst Template Structure

For users who want to modify the core layout, the extension is installed in `_extensions/orehren/acvt/`. The Typst files are located in the `typst/` subdirectory.

### File Overview

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `template.typ` | The main entry point. Orchestrates the loading of partials. |
| `typst-template.typ` | Contains the main document structure and logic. |
| `01-definitions-helper-functions.typ` | Helper functions for data processing and icons. |
| `02-definitions-metadata.typ` | **Auto-generated.** Contains the metadata injected from your YAML. |
| `03-definitions-styling.typ` | Defines colors, fonts, and text styles. |
| `04-definitions-parts-functions.typ` | Defines the layout components (`resume-entry`, `visualize-skills-list`, title page, footer). |
| `page.typ` | Page setup (margins, size). |
| `typst-show.typ` | Global show rules. |

To customize these files, you can copy them to your project root and update the `template-partials` in your `_extension.yml` (or `_quarto.yml`) to point to your local versions.
